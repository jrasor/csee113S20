## Welcome!
This GitHub repository contains the source code for Bosco Tech course CSEE 113, Introduction to
Robotics. It is developed from https://github.com/first-tech-challenge/SkyStone designed to control 
a *FIRST* Tech Challenge competition robot for the SkyStone (2019-2020) season. FTC Team 5197 
contributed most of the added code.

To use this SDK, download/clone this entire project to your local computer.

## Getting Started
If you are new to robotics or new to the *FIRST* Tech Challenge, then you should consider reviewing 
the [FTC Blocks Tutorial](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE/wiki/Blocks-Tutorial) 
to get familiar with how to use the control system:

(https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE/wiki/Blocks-Tutorial)

Even if you are an advanced Java programmer, it is helpful to start with the [FTC Blocks tutorial]
(https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE/wiki/Blocks-Tutorial), and then migrate to the 
[OnBot Java Tool](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE/wiki/OnBot-Java-Tutorial) or to 
[Android Studio](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE/wiki/Android-Studio-Tutorial) 
afterwards.

The actual development was done with Android Studio.

## Downloading the Project
If you are an Android Studio programmer, there are several ways to download this repo.  Note that 
if you use the Blocks or OnBot Java Tool to program your robot, then you do not need to download 
this repository.

* If you are a git user, you can get onto your command line and clone the most current version of 
this repository:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git clone 
https://github.com/jrasor/csee113S20.git</p>

* Or, if you prefer, you can use the "Download Zip" button available through the main repository page.  
Downloading the project as a .ZIP file will keep the size of the download manageable.

* You can also download the project folder (as a .zip or .tar.gz archive file) from the Downloads 
subsection of the [Releases](https://github.com/jrasor/csee113S20/releases) page for this repository.

Once you have downloaded and uncompressed (if needed) your folder, you can use Android Studio to 
import the folder  ("Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)").
